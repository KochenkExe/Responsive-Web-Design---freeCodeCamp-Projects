          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe
          the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML
          dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
          should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
        </p>

          CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized
          across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the
          development of various parts of CSS specification was done
          synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest
          recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even
          CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now
          just "CSS" with individual CSS modules having version numbers.

          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web
          pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what
          CSS, what the basic syntax looks like, and how your browser applies
          CSS to HTML to style it.

        <p>
          CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules by specifying groups
          of styles that should be applied to particular element or groups of
          elements on your web page.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, you might decide to style the main heading on your page
          as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule
          that would achieve this:
        </p>
        <code> h1 { color: red; font-size: 2.5em; } </code>
        <p>
          Different CSS properties have different allowable values. In our
          example, we have the color property, which can take various color
          values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take
          various size units as a value.
        </p>
        <p>
          A CSS stylesheet contains many such rules, written one after the
          other.
        </p>
        <code
          >h1 { color: red; font-size: 2.5em; } p { color: aqua; padding: 5px;
          background: midnightblue; }
        </code>

        <p>
          You've already seen how, in CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML
          elements on our web pages that we want to style. There are a wide
          variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained
          precision when selecting elements to style, and in the next few
          articles we'll look at the different types in depth. In this article
          we'll recap some selector fundamentals, including the basic type,
          class, and ID selectors, and selector lists. We'll also introduce the
          universal selector.
        </p>
        <p>
          A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of
          elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements
          should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule
          applied to them. The element or elements which are selected by the
          selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Type Selector</li>
          <li>Class Selector</li>
          <li>ID Selector</li>
          <li>Universal Selector</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Type Selector</h3>
        <p>
          A type selector is sometimes referred to as a tag name selector or
          element selector because it selects an HTML tag/element in your
          document. In the example below, we have used the span, em and strong
          selectors.
        </p>
        <code>body { font-family: sans-serif; } </code>
        <h3>Class Selector</h3>
        <p>
          The case-sensitive class selector starts with a dot (.) character. It
          will select everything in the document with that class applied to it.
          In the live example below we have created a class called highlight,
          and have applied it to several places in my document. All of the
          elements that have the class applied are highlighted.
        </p>
        <code>.highlight { background-color: yellow; }</code>
        <h3>ID Selector</h3>
        <p>
          The case-sensitive ID selector begins with a # rather than a dot
          character, but is used in the same way as a class selector. The
          difference is that an ID can be used only once per page, and elements
          can only have a single id value applied to them. It can select an
          element that has the id set on it, and you can precede the ID with a
          type selector to only target the element if both the element and ID
          match. You can see both of these uses in the following example:
        </p>
        <code>#one { background-color: yellow; }</code>
        <h3>Universal Selector</h3>
        <p>
          The universal selector is indicated by an asterisk (*). It selects
          everything in the document. If * is chained using a descendant
          combinator, it selects everything inside that ancestor element. For
          example, p * selects all the nested elements inside the p element.
        </p>
        <code> * { margin: 0; } </code>

        <header>CSS Text Styling</header>
        <p>
          The CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two
          categories, which we'll look at separately in this article:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Font styles: Properties that affect a text's font, e.g., which font
            gets applied, its size, and whether it's bold, italic, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Text layout styles: Properties that affect the spacing and other
            layout features of the text, allowing manipulation of, for example,
            the space between lines and letters, and how the text is aligned
            within the content box.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Color</h3>
        <p>
          The color property sets the color of the foreground content of the
          selected elements, which is usually the text, but can also include a
          couple of other things, such as an underline or overline placed on
          text using the text-decoration property.
        </p>
        <code>p { color: red; } </code>
        <h3>Font Families</h3>
        <p>
          To set a different font for your text, you use the font-family
          property — this allows you to specify a font (or list of fonts) for
          the browser to apply to the selected elements. The browser will only
          apply a font if it is available on the machine the website is being
          accessed on; if not, it will just use a browser default font. A simple
          example looks like so:
        </p>
        <code>p { font-family: Arial; } </code>
